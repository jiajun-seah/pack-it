# Pack-It!
Pack-It! is a puzzle game that encourages players to bring their own lunchboxes instead of using disposable plastics when ordering takeaway food.
The game is primarily built for web but was later extended to macOS as well (experimental).

# Description
Developed using Dart and Flutter, Pack-It! is an app-like game developed to encourage players to swap the use of single-use plastics for their own reusable lunchboxes. 
Comprising a total of 8 unqiue levels, use context clues such as position, colours, size and design patterns to solve each level. The completion of a level rewards players with a winning screen that replaces the use of a styrofoam box with a lunchbox wrapped in a colourful cloth (inspired by traditional Japanese wrapping cloths called Furoshiki, traditionally used to wrap goods) with a symbol of a plant or flower.

# Installation
You can access the game directly via the web app hosted on Firebase at the following link: https://pack-it-game.web.app/  

If you wish to run the game locally, clone this repo, then ```flutter run```. The game is developed for web and MacOS.

Note: Remember to set up Flutter for web and MacOS respectively (See: https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/building and https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/macos/building) if you have not done so.
